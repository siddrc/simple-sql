 Design a school schema:
 -A school would have classes
 -Classes have teachers (teaching staff) 
 -Classes have students
 -Each Class has a Monitor ( Monitor is among the students) 
 -A school has a Principal
 -School also has practical-labs
 -School also has an amphi-theatre
 -Amphi-Theatre has a seating capacity, projector, operator etc.
 -School has a cleaning staff
 -School has a administrative staff
 -School has a management council or a board or mgmt staff
 -Students pay fees
 -Each fees paid has a associated receipt
 -School pays out salary as well

 Think of all the possible relations
 like Primary Key from which table would be referenced as a FK in which table etc.

 Once the schema is in place: we will then make a REST-API to fill the database with data
